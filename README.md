The colour of the row will change based on if the current hour is later than the row (red), the same as the row (grey), or earlier than the row (green). The current time in the image below is 13:00.

When the user inputs into a specifc row, and presses the save button for that row, the input is saved to local storage and the row value stays as the input. This stays even if the page is refreshed.
